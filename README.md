# woteconv
command-line tool that takes a commonevent file and prints a text conversion to stdout

the output isn't super readable (it's similar to the editor's built-in text conversion), but it may be useful for git textconv

## usage
```
woteconv.exe <file>
```
file name must contain `CommonEvent.dat` or `.common` to be recognized
